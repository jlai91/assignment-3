-Trading Psychology: How to Handle FOMO (Dr. Steenbarger):

Possibly the biggest issue that comes from messing up is the panic associated with the mistake. Instead of panicking over a mistake, it is ideal to adopt a calm but attentive manner when handling mistakes (or a possibility of one).

There are multiple methods to overcoming the habit of panic. One method is to prioritize a positive outcome over the negative one that is resulting in panic. Another is to practice a calm mindset and forcibly embed it into stressful scenarios.

(The methods are similar to the concept of meditation, where you are expected to enter a state of neutrality and maintain it while envisioning stressful experiences)

In short, look at failure in a positive light where possible (and it is almost always possible).

(not gonna lie, it took a while to figure out that TDD stood for Test-Driven Development. I'm not familiar with the term at all, though I get the idea of what it means)

Tests are effective at establishing a checklist of requirements and keeping track of your progress as you code. Setting aside the potentially strict rules of what kind of tests to make and how they should be established, having a mindset of verifying your work's functionality can be integral to programming efficiently.
